description: This dataset contains sorted unit spiking times and behavioral data from
  a macaque performing a reaching task with perturbations. In the experimental task,
  the subject performed delayed center-out reaches using a manipulandum to control
  a cursor. On a portion of the trials, the manipulandum applied a bump during the
  center hold prior to the reach. Neural activity was recorded from an electrode array
  implanted in somatosensory area 2. Hand position, cursor position, force applied
  to the manipulandum, length and velocity of various arm muscles, and angle and velocity
  of various arm joints were all recorded during the experiment.
